# Product Requirements Document: Shein Product Scraper & Data Exporter

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Python-based web scraping application designed to extract product information from Shein.com. The application will function as a full-stack web application, providing a user interface for inputting category links, monitoring the scraping process, and exporting the extracted data. A key aspect of this application is the implementation of advanced techniques to bypass Shein's anti-bot detection systems to ensure reliable data extraction. The primary goal is to reliably collect detailed product information (images, title, price, color, size, description) from specified Shein product listing pages and their subsequent product detail pages, storing it efficiently and enabling export in CSV format. The application is intended to be robust, production-ready, and follow industry best practices for UI/UX.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

* **G1:** Develop a reliable web scraper capable of extracting product links from Shein category listing pages, handling pagination across all pages within a category.
* **G2:** Develop a reliable web scraper capable of extracting specific product details (images, title, price, color, size, description) from individual Shein product detail pages using provided XPaths.
* **G3:** Implement highly advanced anti-bot bypass mechanisms to counteract Shein's detection systems and ensure consistent scraping capabilities.
* **G4:** Implement a mechanism to store the extracted product data persistently and efficiently.
* **G5:** Develop a user-friendly full-stack web application with a polished UI/UX to facilitate the input of category links, display the scraping progress, and enable data export.
* **G6:** Ensure the application is robust, handles potential errors gracefully (e.g., network issues, changes in website structure â€“ within reasonable limits), and is suitable for a production environment.
* **G7:** Provide functionality to export the scraped and stored data into a standard CSV file format.

## 3. User Stories

* **US 1.0:** As a user, I want to input one or more Shein category listing page URLs into the web application so that the scraper knows which categories to process.
* **US 1.1:** As a user, I want the application to automatically navigate through all pages of a given category listing URL to find all individual product links.
* **US 1.2:** As a user, I want the application to visit each identified product link and extract specific details like images, title, price, color, size, and description.
* **US 1.3:** As a user, I want the scraper to effectively bypass Shein's anti-bot detection so that scraping is not blocked or hindered.
* **US 1.4:** As a user, I want the extracted product data to be stored persistently so that I can access it later.
* **US 1.5:** As a user, I want to see the progress of the scraping process (e.g., which category is being processed, how many products found, how many products scraped), including status related to bot detection challenges.
* **US 1.6:** As a user, I want to be able to download the scraped product data in a structured format, specifically a CSV file.
* **US 1.7:** As a user, I want the web application interface to be intuitive and easy to use, following standard web application design principles.
* **US 1.8:** As a user, I want the application to be stable and handle temporary issues, including bot detection challenges, without crashing.

## 4. Features

### 4.1 Category Link Input

* **Description:** The web application will provide an interface for users to input one or multiple Shein category listing page URLs.
* **Requirements:**
    * Users must be able to paste or type URLs into an input field or textarea.
    * Support for adding multiple URLs (e.g., one per line, or through multiple input fields).
    * Validation to ensure the input is a valid URL format and ideally a Shein URL (though strict Shein validation might be complex and can be a future enhancement).

### 4.2 Product Link Extraction (Pagination Handling)

* **Description:** For each valid category URL provided, the scraper will navigate to the page and extract all links pointing to individual product detail pages. It must identify and follow pagination links to ensure all products within the category across all pages are captured.
* **Requirements:**
    * Identify product links on the initial category page.
    * Identify the pagination controls (e.g., "Next" button, page numbers).
    * Iterate through all available pages of the category listing by following the pagination links.
    * Collect all unique product detail page URLs found across all pages for a given category.
    * Handle cases where pagination might be implemented differently or is absent.

### 4.3 Product Data Extraction

* **Description:** For each unique product detail page URL collected, the scraper will visit the page and extract specific data points using pre-defined XPaths.
* **Requirements:**
    * Navigate to each collected product URL.
    * Extract the following information using the provided XPaths:
        * All product images (URLs of the images).
        * Product Title.
        * Product Price.
        * Product Color(s).
        * Product Size(s).
        * Product Description.
    * Handle cases where certain data points might be missing on a product page.
    * Associate the extracted data with the corresponding product URL and potentially the category it was found under.

### 4.4 Highly Advanced Anti-Bot Bypass Mechanisms

* **Description:** The scraper must incorporate advanced techniques to avoid detection and blocking by Shein's anti-bot systems.
* **Requirements:**
    * Implement techniques to mimic human Browse behavior (e.g., realistic mouse movements, random delays between actions, scrolling).
    * Manage browser fingerprints (e.g., modifying user agents, handling browser properties that reveal automation).
    * Handle CAPTCHAs if encountered (potentially requires third-party CAPTCHA solving services, which adds complexity and cost, or notification to the user in the UI).
    * Rotate IP addresses (requires integration with proxy services).
    * Handle cookies and sessions appropriately.
    * Detect and respond to common bot detection challenges (e.g., hidden fields, JavaScript challenges).
    * The implementation should aim for a high success rate against Shein's current anti-bot measures, acknowledging that this is an ongoing effort that may require updates.

### 4.5 Data Storage (SQLite)

* **Description:** The extracted product data will be stored persistently using an SQLite database.
* **Requirements:**
    * Design a database schema to efficiently store the extracted data (Product URL as primary key, columns for title, price, color, size, description, and potentially a related table for image URLs).
    * Implement database connection and data insertion logic within the Python application.
    * Ensure data integrity and handle potential duplicate entries based on the product URL.

### 4.6 Data Export (CSV)

* **Description:** Users must be able to export the data stored in the database into a CSV file format via the web application interface.
* **Requirements:**
    * Provide an "Export to CSV" button or link in the UI.
    * Generate a CSV file containing all or selected scraped data.
    * The CSV file should have appropriate headers corresponding to the extracted data fields (Title, Price, Color, Size, Description, Image URLs, Product URL, etc.).
    * Handle the formatting of complex data like multiple image URLs or multiple colors/sizes within the CSV format (e.g., comma-separated values within a cell).

### 4.7 Web Application

* **Description:** A full-stack web application built with Flask will provide the user interface and backend logic to manage the scraping process and data export.
* **Requirements:**
    * Implement a Flask backend to handle HTTP requests, trigger scraping jobs, interact with the database, and serve the frontend.
    * Develop a frontend using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to provide a polished user interface.
    * Implement a mechanism to display the status and progress of the scraping process in the UI (e.g., "Idle," "Processing," "Completed," "Error," status related to bot detection challenges).
    * Include navigation or sections for inputting URLs, viewing status, and exporting data.
    * Adhere to industry UI/UX best practices for layout, navigation, responsiveness, and user feedback.

## 5. Technical Requirements

* **Tech Stack:**
    * **Backend:** Python 3
    * **Scraping Library:** Selenium (required due to dynamic content loading on modern websites like Shein)
    * **Browser Driver Management:** `webdriver_manager` (to automatically handle browser driver downloads)
    * **Web Framework:** Flask
    * **Database:** SQLite
* **XPaths:** Placeholders for now. These will be provided and need to be accurately implemented in the scraping logic.
    * `XPATH_PRODUCT_LINK = "placeholder"`
    * `XPATH_PAGINATION_NEXT = "placeholder"`
    * `XPATH_PAGINATION_PAGE_NUMBERS = "placeholder"`
    * `XPATH_PRODUCT_IMAGES = "placeholder"`
    * `XPATH_PRODUCT_TITLE = "placeholder"`
    * `XPATH_PRODUCT_PRICE = "placeholder"`
    * `XPATH_PRODUCT_COLOR = "placeholder"`
    * `XPATH_PRODUCT_SIZE = "placeholder"`
    * `XPATH_PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION = "placeholder"`
* **Browser Automation:** Requires a headless browser controlled by Selenium (e.g., Headless Chrome or Firefox). `webdriver_manager` should be used to simplify driver setup. The application should include configuration options or instructions for setting this up.
* **Anti-Bot Implementation:** Implement techniques detailed in Feature 4.4. This is a complex area and may require significant development effort and ongoing maintenance.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for:
    * Network errors (timeouts, connection refused).
    * Changes in website structure that invalidate XPaths (graceful failure, logging).
    * Errors during data extraction for individual products (skip and log, don't stop the whole process).
    * Bot detection and blocking events (attempt recovery, log the event).
    * Database errors.
    * Invalid user input.
* **Robustness & Production Readiness:**
    * Implement logging for monitoring and debugging, including logging related to anti-bot bypass attempts and failures.
    * Manage resources effectively (memory, CPU) to avoid crashing, especially during large scraping jobs.
    * Implement rate limiting or delays between requests to avoid being blocked by the target website (consider `time.sleep()`, potentially dynamic delays based on perceived detection).
    * Structure the code in a modular and maintainable way.
    * Include necessary dependencies and setup instructions (`requirements.txt` including `selenium`, `webdriver_manager`, `flask`, `sqlite` related libraries).
    * Consider background task processing for scraping jobs to keep the web application responsive (e.g., using libraries like Celery with a message broker like Redis, or simple threading/multiprocessing for less complex deployments).
* **Scalability:** While the initial scope is for a single instance, consider the architecture to allow for potential future scaling (e.g., processing multiple scraping jobs concurrently). This will likely involve managing proxy rotations and bot bypass measures across multiple instances. SQLite might become a bottleneck for very large datasets or concurrent writes, but is acceptable for the initial implementation as per the requirements.

## 6. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Requirements

* **Layout:** Clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for input, status, and export.
* **Input:** A prominent area for users to input category URLs, with clear instructions.
* **Status Display:** A dedicated section to show the real-time progress of the scraping process, including:
    * Current status (e.g., "Idle," "Processing," "Attempting Bypass," "Blocked," "Completed," "Error").
    * Current category being scraped.
    * Number of product links found.
    * Number of products successfully scraped.
    * Error messages, including details related to potential bot detection or blocking.
* **Data View (Optional but Recommended):** A simple table or list view to display the scraped data within the web app itself before export, allowing users to preview the results.
* **Export Button:** A clearly labeled button or link to trigger the CSV export.
* **Responsiveness:** The UI should be responsive and work well on different screen sizes.
* **User Feedback:** Provide clear feedback to the user on actions (e.g., "Scraping started," "Attempting to bypass bot detection," "Export successful," validation errors).

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:**
    * Scraping speed will be affected by the anti-bot bypass measures (e.g., delays, retries). Performance should be optimized while prioritizing successful data extraction and avoiding detection.
    * The web application should be responsive to user interactions.
* **Security:**
    * Sanitize user input to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    * While the data being scraped is public, ensure the application itself is not vulnerable to common web security issues (e.g., XSS, CSRF) relevant to a Flask application.
    * Protect the SQLite database file with appropriate file permissions in a production environment.
* **Reliability:**
    * The application should be able to run for extended periods without crashing.
    * Errors should be handled gracefully and logged.
    * The application should attempt recovery from bot detection/blocking events.
    * The application should be able to resume or restart without losing previously scraped data (assuming the database is intact).
* **Maintainability:**
    * Code should be well-organized, commented, and follow Python best practices (e.g., PEP 8).
    * Dependencies should be managed properly (`requirements.txt`).
    * The anti-bot bypass code is likely to require ongoing maintenance as target websites update their defenses.
* **Scalability:** (As mentioned in Technical Requirements) The architecture should ideally allow for future scaling, even if not implemented in the initial version. Scaling will need to account for the complexities introduced by anti-bot measures.

## 8. Future Considerations (Optional)

* Integration with third-party CAPTCHA solving services.
* Integration with proxy rotation services.
* Scheduling of scraping jobs.
* Support for different e-commerce websites.
* More sophisticated error reporting and alerting (e.g., email notifications on persistent blocking).
* User authentication and multi-user support.
* Deployment scripts (e.g., Dockerfile).
* More detailed configuration options in the UI (e.g., delay ranges, number of retries for bypass).
